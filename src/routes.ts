/**
 * Canonical route metadata for thechrisgrey.com.
 *
 * Single source of truth for everything routing-adjacent that lived in three
 * places before this file existed:
 *
 *   - `src/App.tsx`             — the JSX `<Route>` definitions (still authored
 *                                  by hand for readability; a test in
 *                                  `routes.test.ts` asserts every path there is
 *                                  in this table)
 *   - `src/utils/routeManifest.ts` — derives the prefetch-on-hover importers from
 *                                     `ROUTES`
 *   - `src/utils/pageContext.ts`   — derives `ROUTE_CONTEXT_MAP` (Alti's
 *                                     grounding context per page) and
 *                                     `PAGE_SUGGESTIONS` (Alti's starter chips
 *                                     per page) from `ROUTES`
 *
 * Adding a route: append one entry here, then add the matching `<Route>` to
 * App.tsx. The other two surfaces pick it up automatically. The `routes.test.ts`
 * pair-check will fail the build if you forget App.tsx.
 *
 * The Home route ('/') is intentionally NOT in this table — it's the only
 * static (non-lazy) route, has no prefetch (it's the entrypoint), and its
 * context is overridden by the visitor-context block on every chat anyway.
 * It's noted in `HOME_CONTEXT` below.
